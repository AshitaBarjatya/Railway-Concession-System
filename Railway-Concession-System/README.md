Railway-Concession-System
=========================

 Present Scenario:

Almost all students of our campus tries to avail the concession provided on railway fare.
The forms provided, are not enough to be fetched by all students.
Also the dates of issue and submission of forms are not properly announced .
The whole process including the distribution of application form, its validation,
the issue of concession form goes on manually. All this things make it more troublesome
for the students to apply for concession.


Purpose: Purpose of this project is to give a kind of relax to the students and 
also to the team of validators, by reducing their burden of paper work for verifying the forms.
